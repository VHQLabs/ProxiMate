# ProxiMate

*Done during https://challengerocket.com/mercari hackathon and so code quality is low* 

Platform to share location-based neighbour-to-neighbour services, such as:

* Your parcel can be delivered to your neighbour, when you're not a home
* Walk your dog
* Babysit your children or get them from schoold
* ...

Notable trait is that services are strictly local - you can ask for and offer a service only in your local community. It makes services safer, makes people communicate more and builds stronger local communities.
